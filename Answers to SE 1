B. Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering
The evolution of software engineering has been marked by several key milestones that have shaped the discipline into what it is today. Here are three of the most significant milestones:

1. The Advent of Structured Programming (1960s-1970s)
Description: Before structured programming, software was often written in a "spaghetti code" style, with control flow managed by arbitrary jumps (e.g., "goto" statements). This approach made programs difficult to understand, debug, and maintain. Structured programming introduced the concept of breaking down programs into smaller, manageable blocks or modules using control structures like loops, conditionals, and subroutines.
Impact: Structured programming significantly improved the readability, maintainability, and reliability of software. It laid the foundation for later developments in modular and object-oriented programming.
2. The Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s)
Description: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or "objects," rather than functions and logic. Objects represent real-world entities, with properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). The key principles of OOP include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Impact: OOP revolutionized software engineering by promoting code reusability, scalability, and flexibility. It became the foundation for many modern programming languages (e.g., C++, Java, Python) and is widely used in software development today, particularly in large, complex systems.
3. The Rise of Agile Methodologies (2000s)
Description: Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emerged as a response to the rigid, plan-driven approaches like the Waterfall model. Agile emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback. It values working software over comprehensive documentation and responds to changing requirements, even late in development.
Impact: Agile transformed software engineering by enabling teams to deliver value faster, with better alignment to user needs. It has become the dominant approach in software development, fostering continuous improvement, adaptability, and closer collaboration between developers and stakeholders.
These milestones represent significant shifts in how software is developed, each contributing to the evolution of software engineering as a discipline that balances technical excellence with practical, user-centered solutions.
C. List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that outlines the stages involved in the development of software. Here are the main phases of the SDLC:

1. Planning
Description: This initial phase involves identifying the scope and objectives of the software project. Key activities include feasibility studies, resource allocation, scheduling, and defining the project's goals and deliverables. Planning helps to ensure that the project is viable and sets a clear roadmap for development.
2. Requirements Analysis
Description: In this phase, the specific needs and requirements of the software are gathered and documented. This involves understanding what the users need from the software and defining both functional and non-functional requirements. Clear and thorough requirements analysis is crucial for guiding the design and development phases.
3. Design
Description: The design phase focuses on creating the architecture of the software. This includes designing the overall system architecture, defining data models, and detailing the user interfaces and components. The design serves as a blueprint for the development phase, ensuring that all parts of the system work together cohesively.
4. Implementation (or Development)
Description: During the implementation phase, the actual code is written based on the design specifications. Developers translate the design into a working software product, creating the necessary algorithms, databases, and user interfaces. This is typically the most time-consuming phase of the SDLC.
5. Testing
Description: The testing phase involves systematically checking the software for defects or bugs. Various testing methods, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT), are used to ensure that the software meets the requirements and is free of critical errors.
6. Deployment
Description: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, where it becomes available to users. This phase includes activities like installation, configuration, and ensuring that the software operates smoothly in its intended environment.
7. Maintenance
Description: Once the software is deployed, it enters the maintenance phase, where it is monitored for any issues that arise in the real-world environment. This phase involves fixing bugs, making necessary updates, and adding new features over time to keep the software functional and relevant.
These phases of the SDLC provide a framework for developing software in a systematic and organized manner, helping to ensure that the final product meets user needs and performs reliably.

D.Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall and Agile methodologies are two distinct approaches to software development, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and suitable use cases. Here's a comparison and contrast between the two:

Waterfall Methodology
Overview:

The Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to software development. Each phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) must be completed before moving on to the next one.
The phases typically include Planning, Requirements Analysis, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Key Characteristics:
Sequential Process: Each phase is completed before the next begins, with little to no overlap.
Documentation-Driven: Detailed documentation is produced at each phase, ensuring a clear understanding of the project scope and requirements.
Rigid Structure: Changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed, especially in later stages.
Predictability: The process is highly predictable, with clearly defined stages and deliverables.
When to Use Waterfall:

Stable Requirements: When project requirements are well understood and unlikely to change (e.g., government contracts, infrastructure projects).
Fixed Scope and Timeline: When the project has a fixed scope, budget, and timeline (e.g., construction of embedded systems).
Compliance and Documentation: When thorough documentation and compliance with standards are critical (e.g., medical device software).
Agile Methodology
Overview:

Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback, allowing for frequent adjustments throughout the development process.
Popular Agile frameworks include Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP).
Key Characteristics:
