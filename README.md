# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

##Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software enginering is the process of designing, develop and maintaining softwares
It helps in creation of high quality softwares that power up diffirent aspects of life.

##Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the advent of high level programming languages(1950s- 1960s) - involved low level assembly language.
the development of structured programming(1960s-1970s) - involved top down approach.
the development of object oriented programming(2000s) - involved encapsulation

##List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements gathering - documents user needs
2. Design - create detailed design of the software architecture
3. Implementation - writing code to create the software designed earlier
4. Testing - ensures that all tha modules of the systems are working as expected
5. Deployment - deploy the software to the production environment that is the customers
6. Maintanance - providing enhancements after deployment of the software 


##Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology follows sequential approach flowing down like a waterfall and its used where the user requirements are clearly identified
Agile methodology is iterative and incremental  used where user requirements keeps on changing depending on the satisfaction of the earlier prototype version.

##Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer - write codes and implements software solutions
quality assurance engineer - test and validate software solutions
project manager - manage and coordinate software projects


##Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE's provide tools for writing, testing and debugging codes like vs code, pycharm
VCS keeps track of codes changes and coordinating work among team members like git, gitlab


##What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements, underbudgeting, tight deadlines, lack of communication
Effecive communications, prioritization of tasks, reassessment of roles and timelines

##Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing - test the funtionality of individual modules
intergration testing - tests the interation between diferent modules
system testing - tests the funtionality of the whole system
acceptance testing - tests the user requirements ensuring it meets user requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

##Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
crafting questions and statements to get best responses from AI

##Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt : draw a rectangle
improved prompt : draw a rectangle with a width of 5 units and a height of 10 units
The improved prompt is more effective because it provides clear and specific requirements for the AI model to follow.
