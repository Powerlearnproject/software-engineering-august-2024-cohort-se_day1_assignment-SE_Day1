Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering refers to a field in computer science which applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain hgh quality software systems. It involces product design, development, testing, deployment and maintainace.

Software engineering play a crucial role in technology industry by enabling the creating of software applications and sytems that power various aspects of modern life for instance communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and systems requirements
2. design - creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. development - writing code and building the software according to the design specification
4. testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and function requirements
5. deployment - Releasing the software to users or customers
6. maintanance - Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall approach: This is a sequential approach with distinct phases e.g., requirements, design, implementation while Agile; It is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and responding change


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A sotware developer is responsible for writing code in the language of choice for implementing software solutions
Quality Assuarance Engineer Ensures software quality and reliability by designing and executing test plans
Project manager; oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
