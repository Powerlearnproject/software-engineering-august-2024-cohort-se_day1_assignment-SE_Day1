#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a systematic, disciplined approach to developnment, operation nd maintenance of software.
managing cost-by employing structured methodologies, organisations reduce the risk of expensive overruns and delays.
risk management-engineering practices help identify potential issues early in the development process. thus reducing risks

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The evolution of Software Engineering was marked with different important milestones which led the Software Engineering to the place where it is now, three of these important milestones are:
1.The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term “software engineering” was coined at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in Garmisch, Germany, in 1968. The conference highlighted a growing concern about what was later referred to as the “software crisis": project schedule and budget slippages, software that didn’t work correctly or lacked expected features, and dissatisfaction of software customers.
Impact: This conference made the software community realize that there should be some more formal and disciplined approaches for doing software development. It eventually led to the creation of Software engineering as a legitimate field both for study and practice.
2. Structured Programming Movement 
The 1970s was the era of structured programming, which said that in programs you should use control structures (such as loops and conditionals) rather than arbitrary jumps (i.e., GOTOs). Key thought leaders, including Edsger Dijkstra, were proponents of these ideas and advocated for concepts such as modularity and the clear structure of programs.
Impact: This made a drastic improvement in the quality of software as well as maintainability. Programmers were able to comprehend and consequently control the complexity. These were the basic principles on which all future programming paradigms and with that better software took place.
3. Agile Methodologies 
The Agile Manifesto released in February 2001 describes the values and basic principles of software development that highlighted cooperation, flexibility, and customer-centric approach to business. Scrum and Kanban are agile approaches which pioneered this line of thought as frameworks.
Impact: Agile changed the world of software development by offering an iterative and flexible response to changes in requirements. Teams have been able to embrace feedback and changing markets with increased ease, leading to higher productivity and better software developed in less time.
Summary
These milestones in the evolution of software engineering, which took us from an ad-hoc practice to a more formalized practice to, finally, the agile practices we have today that stress collaboration and flexibility, each had a dramatic impact on improving quality, efficiency and our ability to deliver software in the industry.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is structured and proven process to create, test or deploy software. The RMF has several distinct phases with specific goals, and outputs. Key Phases of SDLC
1. Planning
Description: This is where the project starts - a scope and goal definition has to be taken before to establish whether or not what you want done can actually get done. Stakeholders describe software requirements and perform a business case analysis to determine if it meets the long, medium or short-term aims for an organization.

- Key Activities: Requirement gathering, risk assessment, resource allocation and project scheduling.
 2. Requirement Analysis
Description: Stakeholders and Users gather information on their needs, goals etc. This phase is meant to convert project goals into proper specification.

- Interviews, Surveys etc. to gain Input — Software Requirement Specification(SRS)
 3. Design
  - Description: Develop the software architecture and design, depending on those requirements. During this phase, you define the structure of systems such as components and how they interact with one another via data flow.

- Key Activities: Design specification, UML diagrams and wireframes making and selection of technology stacks.

4. Implementation (Coding)
Developers write the code based on their design specification. ~ Duration: 6-10 weeks This phase turns the design into a software that works.

Key Activities: Writing code, unit testing of components and incorporate software elements.

 5. Testing
Types- Description: The software is tested thoroughly to find and report bugs. Verification and validation process are organized to check, does the product adhere with specified requirements.

Key Activities: Function test, Performance Test, Security Test and UAT

6. Deployment
Instructions: The software is deployed after successful testing to a production environment for use by end-users. This likely includes user training and support documentation.

Key Activities: Release management, user training,Serving in a network of servers or cloud platforms.

7. Maintenance

Description: Once the software is being used, it needs continued support for bug fixes, performance issues and implementation of new features based on user feedback.

- Key Activities: Regular updates, patches and system upgrades
summary
These are the stages involved in Software Development Life Cycle to make sure that the software gets developed properly and is scalable, reliable enough as per user requirements. Every phase is essential to the software project, through careful planning, rigorous testing and relentless improvement.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
- Role: Implement, design, maintain, build systems software, as well as application software.
- Responsibilities: Types and classify codes, define and solve problems and consult with the team as to how to go about them. In charge of code quality though one may not in the same way offer a peer review, this is what one would do.
 Quality Assurance Engineer
- Role: Ensures the level of quality of the software product as well as its use.
- Responsibilities: Develops test strategies and cases, performs manual and automated testing, identifies issue and report them, and collaborate with the software developers to address issues. Guarantees that the software is software that has been built to meet specific standard and quality.
Project Manager
- Role: Is involved in management of the project right from identification stage till theproject is accomplished.
- Responsibilities: Determines what has to be done, when it has to be done, the cost of doing it, how to relay information back to the stakeholders, chances of things going wrong and how they can be prevented, and last of all ensures that the project is completed within the given cost and time frame. Inclusive of the management of team operations, actions regarding team problems or disputes.
These are inter-functional roles, that is they enhance efficiency of processes in the development and delivery of quality software.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
 Integrated development environments are very important in the software development lifecycle since they pull together a complete development platform where coding, compiling, and debugging can be performed in one toolkit. Some benefits that they produce include: code highlighting, code completion, and development tools, all of which are helpful in the development of code. 
 - Example: Visual Studio is one of the popular IDE in writing application in language such as C#, C++, VB and more. NET. It offers potent detecting and executing equipment, thus encouraging software development. 
 
  Importance of Version Control Systems (VCS)  
 VCS are fundamental to tracking modifications of the source code in order to allow several people to work on the same code. They are used to monitor changes, share changes from one contributor to the others by integrating the changes and provide for reversal to previous version in the event of an error. This way reduces risks associated with code change and assists in keeping the integrity of the project high. 
  - Example: Git is one of the most used VCS that supports branching, merging and has integration for a team of developers. Services such as GitHub enable teams to store their repositories on them so that they can easily work on their projects.  
 IDEs and VCS are crucial tools that are highly effective in the process of developing software, making work more efficient, increasing the activity of collaboration between programmers and raising the quality of code.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 Common Challenges Faced by Software Engineers 
  1. Changing Requirements 
 - Challenge: That is why shifting the project’s development goals more often can become problematic. 
 - Strategy: This should be done through the Agile methodologies to help in the management of change and to involve the stakeholders for feedback.  
 2. Technical Debt 
 - Challenge: It is worth to add that thousands of small design and analysis shortcuts together with thousands of suboptimum solutions can cause severe long-term maintenance problems. 
 - Strategy: Refactor the code often and keep the coding standards on the top priority as code must be maintainable. 
  3. Collaboration Issues 
 - Challenge: There can be misunderstandings between the members of the particular team which results in subpar performance and slow work. 
 - Strategy: Encourage more dialogue between teams and employees and integrate solutions such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, etc. 
  4. Time Management 
 - Challenge: Stress results from the ability to handle several tasks and meeting their different deadlines all at once. 
 - Strategy: This is through the use of strategies such as the Pomodoro technique and the use of the Eisenhower matrix. 
  5. Quality Assurance 
 - Challenge: There is always the pressure of trying to maintain the quality of the software while at the same time meeting the set time lines. 
 - Strategy: Use automated tools and methods to testing to detect the errors and follow QA standards to detect them at the early stages.  
 If these issues addressed using efficient solutions, software engineers can increase productiveness and provide first class software products.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Different Types of Testing 
  1. Unit Testing 
The process of testing single components or functions of the software in isolation in order that the tester can check that it is working as required. 
 - Importance: Prevents many errors at the developmental stages of a software, and helps in the manufacturing and troubleshooting of codes. 
  2. Integration Testing 
    Checks how the assortment of subroutines or parts work as a single mechanism or interface since the linking of different elements is performed by an access point. 
 - Importance: Discovers problems in the flow and communications of the data which are hidden in unit testing, allowing for clear interaction with other modules.  
 3. System Testing 
    Verifies that the entire complex of installations meets specified requirements by testing the entire integrated system. 
 - Importance: It verifies all that the entire system is accomplished in a real-life situation, as well as the functions and non-functional aspects.  
 4. Acceptance Testing 
   Carried out to ascertain the level of satisfaction of the business needs and whether the software is fit for use by the end-users or the stakeholders. 
 - Importance: Checks the software for compliance with user requirements and expectations and in a production environment. 
 Summary - Both these testing types are important for SQA because all these types of testing combined guarantee that the constructed software is trustworthy, comprehensively functional, and capable of fulfilling users’ expectations. All the phases play a unique role, that when implemented, can improve the quality of the software being developed as well as the satisfaction of the end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering -  It entails development of pertinent questions that are clear, precise and relevant to the setting for purposes of being able to receive correct and relevant answers. . 
  Importance of Prompt Engineering 
  1. Improves Model Output: Proper constructed questions give better required answers from the AI models improving the flow of communication. 
  2. Customization: It allows users of artificial intelligence to ensure that they provide appropriate responses in meeting user’s need or wherever the user intends the interaction to happen.  
 3. Efficiency: Reduces the time and effort needed in order to create useful responses making the productivity in tasks involving AI high. 
  4. Understanding AI Limitations: Makes it easier for users to know how to ask questions and formulate commands and how they can fully utilise AI. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:  Technology: When scheming the lesson, Mr. Muller attempts to integrate the use or several technologies to the job. 
Improved Prompt:  Category: Artificial Intelligence’ Detailing the impacts of Artificial Intelligence on healthcare now and in the future reflecting on cases plus the benefits of its application.  
 Explanation of Effectiveness 
  1. Clarity: The improvement of the prompt incorporates the focus term—which is artificial intelligence— and the setting where the application is mandatory—healthcare; therefore, directing the search process of the AI. 
  2. Specificity: General information about the topic is no longer expected by preparing specific prompt question which assist in transforming general knowledge answer into useful, specific information. 
  3. Conciseness: This has made the new prompt clearer and more specific as compared to the previous ones and this shall help the students to answer the question straightforward. 
  It is more useful to receive the improved prompt because it is specific, though it does not limit you to a certain theme within the technology field; the details which are given will be beneficial. That results into giving a better interaction with the AI model and is therefore preferred.
