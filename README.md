#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering can be seen as a process whereby a developer identifies a challenge, develops an idea of solution around the challenge, creates and deploys a software for that course and subsequently maintain the software for the development of man and the society at large.
Importance
Software engineering helps us to appreciate the beauty of solving problems using technology. This can be found in the commerce, health sector, transportation, communication and entertainment for a sustainable development.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
In 1973, B and C programming language.
This metamorphosed to the invention of C++ in the year 1979.
Afterwhich, mordern Artificial Intelligence model have been designed that could help developers create more softwares of different kinds through adequate prompting.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design has to do with creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation refers to writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4. The next level is testing, this is conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment is all about releasing the software to users or customers.
6. However, there shoulb be maintenance, this means providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparism: Waterfall and Agile are simply various development methodologies used for software development process.

Contrast: Waterfall is sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall (i.e top to bottom) while Agile is iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change (i.e bottom to top).

Examples of Waterfall are requirements, design, implementation
Examples of Agile includes etreme programming, scrum, software development, Kaban, crystals.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer
Role: Software developers use programming and design knowledge to build software that meets the needs of users. 
Responsibility: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.

Quality Assurance Engineer
Role: A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures that a software product is bug-free and meets quality standards before launch.
Responsibility: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.

Project Manager
Role: Project managers play the lead role in planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing out of a software projects.
Responsibility: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs is software engineering tools which helps us to write, debug and test codes. For examples Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
WHILE
VCS is also a software engineering tools which are basically used to track changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. For example Git and subversions. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges faced includes Changing Requirements, Tight Deadlines, and Technical Debt.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Control or assurance: Quality control or assurance measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.



#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from an AI assistant whereby one is more concise and specific with the command given to an AI software or system to be able to get the best reponse.
Importance: Prompt Engineering helps us to get adequate and desired answers from an AI model or software by not making our prompt vague.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: What is Quantum mechanics?
Improved Prompt: As a Professor of Physics, Using practical illustrations fun, pictorial designs, explain Quantum mechanics to an 8 year old girl.
