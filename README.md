Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.
Importance  of software engineering   is enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  2.Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology uses a sequestial approach with distict phases while agile methodology uses iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility,collaboration and respond to change
Waterfall is applicable when all the requirements are know upfront and minimal chnages are expected while agile is applicable where there's user feedback during the development time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1. Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  2. Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  3. Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs and VCS  enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.
IDEs include Visual studio code VSC include Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing requirements,tight deadlines and technical debt
Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
 1. Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  2. Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  3. System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  4. Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

importance
Quality control measures such as code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration help identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is  crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant.
Importance - makes your questions clear  and specific,so that the AI   understands exactly what you need.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Tell me about sports people play on their free time and what  they require"
"Tell me about football and the requirements i require to play"
