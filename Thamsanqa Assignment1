#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering  is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
Importance of software engineering  in the technology industry is to enable the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1 the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
2 the advent of structured programming in the 1970s
3 the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design -Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deploymen - Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. (e.g requirements, design, implementation) 
Agile is a iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.
  

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g. Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems (VCS) are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g. Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Changing Requirements - Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines - Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt - Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies for Overcoming Challenges include effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
Integration Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
Importance of Quality Assurance is that it helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
Importance in interacting with AI models  is that it helps improve the interaction between humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: "Search for houses on sale".
Improved Prompt: "Search for houses on sale in South Africa around Pretoria, price range R300 000 to R800 000".
Improved prompt is more specific and clear. Al agent will only search in the specified location and price range instead of searching the whole world.
